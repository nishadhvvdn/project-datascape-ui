                    <p class="tabParagraph">
                        Each graph has several different tools available to you. These tools are contained in a column
                        to
                        the
                        right of the graph. From the top, down, the available functions are:</p>
                    <ul class="tabList">
                        <li>1. <strong>Graph Type:</strong> Here you can select what type of graph to display from a
                            dropdown
                            (this
                            is called outage type on the outage graphing page)</li>
                        <li>2. <strong>DTC ID:</strong> This dropdown can be used to select what DTCs are used to plot
                            the
                            graph</li>
                        <li>3. <strong>Date:</strong> The date dropdown allows you to create a custom timeframe to plot
                            the
                            graph
                            on</li>
                        <li>4. <strong>View Table:</strong> The view table button creates a table that shows all the
                            data used
                            to
                            plot the graph</li>

                    <p class="tabParagraph">Beyond these functions, the graphing page also supports two other pieces of
                        functionality you may
                        take advantage of. These include hi-lighting a single line on a multi-line graph–which can be
                        done
                        by
                        clicking appropriate
                        line in the legend–and, pulling up more detail on a single point in the graph by scrolling
                        directly
                        over
                        it.</p>

                        On every graphing page there is a button called "View Table". When clicked, you are taken to
                        a
                        table
                        view of all of the data used to create the graph. This table can be directly modified from that
                        same
                        page (i.e. the date and devices shown can be changed in the same way you would on the graphing
                        page).

                        in
                        the selected DTCs over time, and the second plots the avg ambient temperature around the

                        The avg. kWh delivered by day graph shows seven lines. Each line will correspond to one of the
                        days
                        of
                        the week plotted over 24 hours. Each point shows the avg usage for the selected DTCs over the
                        chosen
                        timeframe for the point selected. For example, selecting a three-week period and scrolling over
                        the
                        Wednesday line at the 03 point would be showing you the avg usage at 3am on Wednesday over the
                        last
                        3
                        weeks for the selected DTCs.

                        transformers in the selected DTCs to the connected meters. The second line shows how much was

                        by the meters and the third shows the delta between these two.</p>
