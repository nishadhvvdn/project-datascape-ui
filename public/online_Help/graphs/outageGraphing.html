                            Each graph has several different tools available to you. These tools are contained in a
                            column to
                            the right of the graph. From the top, down, the available functions are:</p>

                            <ul class="tabList">
                                <li>1. <strong>Graph Type:</strong> Here you can select what type of graph to display from a
                                    dropdown
                                    (this is called outage type on the outage graphing page)</li>
                                <li>2. <strong>DTC ID:</strong> This dropdown can be used to select what DTCs are used to plot
                                    the
                                    graph</li>
                                <li>3. <strong>Date:</strong> The date dropdown allows you to create a custom timeframe to plot
                                    the
                                    graph on</li>
                                <li>4. <strong>View Table:</strong> The view table button creates a table that shows all the
                                    data used
                                    to plot the graph</li>

                            you may
                            take advantage of. These include hi-lighting a single line on a multi-line graph–which can
                            be done
                            by clicking appropriate line in the legend–and pulling up more detail on a single point in
                            the graph
                            by scrolling directly over it.</p>

                            view of all of the data used to create the graph. This table can be directly modified from
